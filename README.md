This repo exists to take pre-trained AI CV models and apply them to some of my old / low-resolution images. It heavily borrows from [`ai-forever`](https://github.com/ai-forever/Real-ESRGAN) with modifications.


How to use it: 

    - put a file in the <kdb>input/</kdb>> and change the file variable in the code
    - put a file in the <kdb>output/</kdb>> and change the variable in the code
    - run the code
